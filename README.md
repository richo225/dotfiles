# .files

My personal dotfiles for macOS and fish, based on the amazing https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

1. Install this repo with `curl` available:


```bash
bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richo225/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"
```

This will clone or download, this repo to `~/.dotfiles` depending on the availability of `git`, `curl` or `wget`.

1. Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richo225/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install everything [listed above](#package-overview), and symlink [runcom](./runcom)
and [config](./config) (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```

## Post-Installation

- `dot dock` (set [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh))
- `dot macos` (set [macOS defaults](./macos/defaults.sh))
- Mackup
  - Log in to Dropbox (and wait until synced)
  - `ln -s ~/.config/mackup/.mackup.cfg ~` (until [#632](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/632) is fixed)
  - `mackup restore`
